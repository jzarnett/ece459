# Live coding exercise: dynamically choosing a data structure

We are going to explore the behaviour of various Rust data structures,
including Vec, VecDeque and im::Vector.

Workload 1: insert and remove at the end/start of a Vec
Workload 2: ok, randomly select some elements that go in/come out at the start/end as well
Workload 3: random access insertions/deletions
