The first thing is to try really common passwords.

You just might get a hit!

  \frametitle{Breaking the Hash}
  
    How can we reverse the hash function?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item    Brute force.

    GPUs (or custom hardware) are good at that!

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Arms Race: Making Cracking Difficult}
  
    Historically: force repeated iterations of hashing.\\[1em]

    Main idea behind scrypt (hence DogeCoin):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item make hashing expensive in time and space.
    \end{itemize}~\\
    Implication: require more circuitry to break passwords.\\
    Increases both \# of operations and cost of brute-forcing.

    Want to force use of the ``most memory possible'' for a given
    number of operations.\\[1em]
  
    \begin{defn}
      A \emph{memory-hard} algorithm on a Random Access Machine is an
      algorithm which uses $S(n)$ space and $T(n)$ operations, where
      $S(n) \in \Omega(T(n)^{1-\varepsilon})$.
    \end{defn}~\\
    
      Such algorithms are expensive to implement in either hardware or software.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Generalizing to functions}
  
    Next, add a quantifier: \\move from particular algorithms to underlying functions.\\[1em]
    A \emph{sequential memory-hard function} is one where:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item the fastest
        sequential algorithm is memory-hard; and
      \item it is impossible for a
        parallel algorithm to asymptotically achieve lower cost.

    \emph{Exhibit.} ReMix is a concrete example of a sequential memory hard function.\\[1em]
    The scrypt paper concludes with an example of a more realistic (cache-aware) model and
    a function in that context, BlockMix.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Across the Rainbow Bridge}

If designed well, hash functions aren't easy to brute force.

What if we remembered some previous work? 

It isn't practical, or possible, to store the hashes for every possible plaintext.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Rainbow Table}

The rainbow table is a compromise between speed and space. 

The ``reduction'' function maps hashes to plaintext:

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/rainbow-tables-reduce.png}
\end{center}

Example: \texttt{123456} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e} $\rightarrow$ 418980

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Chain Formation}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/rainbow-tables-reduce.png}
\end{center}

We should do this to develop some number of chains. 

This is the sort of task you could do with a GPU, because they can do a reduction relatively efficiently. 

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Or, y'know, just download them}

Once we have those developed for a specific input set and hash function, they can be re-used forever. 

You do not even need to make them yourself anymore (if you don't want) because you can download them on the internet... they are not hard to find. 

They are large, yes, but in the 25 - 900 GB range. 


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Rated `S' for Suck}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/Fallout_76_box_cover.jpg}
\end{center}

I mean, Fallout 76 had a day one patch of 52 GB, and it was a disaster of a game.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How to Use Rainbow Tables}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Look for the hash in the list of final hashes; if there, we are done
	\item If it's not there, reduce the hash into another plaintext and hash the new plaintext
	\item Go back to step 1
	\item If the hash matches a final hash, the chain with the match contains the original hash
	\item Having identified the correct chain, we can start at the beginning of the chain with the starting plaintext and hash, check to see if we are successful (if so, we are done); if not, reduce and try the next plaintext. 
\end{enumerate} 

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Is it Fast?}

Like generation, checking the tables can also be done efficiently by the GPU.

Some numbers from \url{http://www.cryptohaze.com/gpurainbowcracker.php.html}: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Table generation on a GTX295 core for MD5 proceeds at around 430M links/sec.
	\item Cracking a password 'K\#n\&r4Z': real: 1m51.962s, user: 1m4.740s. sys: 0m15.320s
\end{itemize}

Yikes.

Custom hardware: optimize exactly what you need.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Please Don't}

We've uncovered why you should not mine Bitcoin.

Not cost efficient; way too much competition.

Not a hardware course, but this is the logical extension of GPU...
