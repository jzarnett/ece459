\frametitle{Basic Overview}


\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
General idea:\\
\qquad collect data on what parts of the code\\
\qquad are taking up most of the time.

\begin{itemize}
\item What functions get called?
\item How long do functions take?
\item What's using memory?
\end{itemize}
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\texttt{printf}}


\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
There is always the ``informal'' way: ``debug'' by print statements.

On entry to \texttt{foo}, log ``entering function foo'', plus timestamp.

On exit, log ``exiting foo'', also with timestamp.
\end{changemargin}

\frametitle{Console Profiling}


\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Kind of works, and [JZ] has used it... But this approach is not necessarily good.  

This is ``invasive'' profiling---change the source code of the program to add instrumentation (log statements). 

Plus we have to do a lot of manual accounting.

Doesn't really scale.

\frametitle{Development vs Prod}

You can always profile your systems in development, but that might not
help with complexities in production. 

The constraints on profiling 
production systems are that the profiling must not affect the system's
performance or reliability.


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Per-Process}

 We'll first talk about {\tt perf}, the profiler 
recommended for use with Rust. This is Linux-specific, though.

The \texttt{perf} tool is an interface to the Linux kernel's built-in
sample-based profiling using CPU counters.

\frametitle{Do it with Rust}

The first thing to do is to compile with debugging info. Go to your \texttt{Cargo.toml} file and add:
\begin{verbatim}
[profile.release]
debug = true
\end{verbatim}

This means that \verb+cargo build --release+ will now compile the version with debug info.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{I've got a Cunning Plan}

Run the program using \texttt{perf record}, which will sample the execution of the program to produce a data set.


Then there are three ways we can look at the code: \texttt{perf report}, \texttt{perf annotate}, and a flamegraph.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CLion}

During development of some of the code exercises, I used the CLion built-in profiler for this purpose. 

It generates a flamegraph for you too, and I'll show that for how to create the flamegraph as well.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Profiler Guided Optimization}


Using static analysis, \\
the compiler makes its best predictions about runtime behaviour.

Example: branch prediction. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
    fn which_branch(a: i32, b: i32) {
        if a < b {
            println!("Case one.");
        } else {
            println!("Case two.");
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\frametitle{A Virtual Call to Devirtualize}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
trait Polite {
    fn greet(&self) -> String;
}

struct Kenobi {
    /* Stuff */
}
impl Polite for Kenobi {
    fn greet(&self) -> String {
        return String::from("Hello there!");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\columnbreak
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
struct Grievous {
    /* Things */
}
impl Polite for Grievous {
    fn greet(&self) -> String {
        return String::from("General Kenobi.");
    }
}

fn devirtualization(thing: &Polite) {
    println!("{}", thing.greet());
}

\end{lstlisting}
\end{multicols}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Match}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
    fn match_thing(x: i32) -> i32 {
        match x {
            0..10 => 1,
            11..100 => 2,
            _ => 0
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Same thing with \texttt{x}: what is its typical value? If we know that, it is our prediction. 

Actually, in a match block with many options, could we rank them in descending order of likelihood?

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Adapting to an Uncertain World}


How can we know where we go?
\begin{itemize}
\item could provide hints\ldots
\end{itemize}

Java HotSpot virtual machine: updates predictions on the fly. 

So, just guess.\\
If wrong, the Just-in-Time compiler adjusts \& recompiles.

The compiler runs and it does its job and that's it; the program is never updated with newer predictions if more data becomes known.


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Profiling Mitigates Uncertainty}



Rust: usually no adaptive runtime system.

POGO:
\begin{itemize}
\item observe actual runs;
\item predict the future.
\end{itemize}

So, we need multi-step compilation:
\begin{itemize}
\item compile with profiling;
\item run to collect data;
\item recompile with profiling data to optimize.
\end{itemize}



\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Step One: Measure}



First, generate an executable with instrumentation. 

The compiler inserts a bunch of probes into the generated code to record data. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Function entry probes;
\item Edge probes;
\item Value probes.
\end{itemize}

Result: instrumented executable plus empty database file (for profiling data).


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Step Two: Training Day}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/training-day.jpg}
\end{center}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Step Two: Training Day}



Second, run the instrumented executable.

Real-world scenarios are best.

Ideally, spend training time on perf-critical sections. 

Use as many runs as you can stand.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Step Two: Training Day}



Don't exercise every part of the program (not SE 465/ECE 453 here!)

That would be counterproductive.

Usage data must match real world scenarios,\\
... or the compiler gets misinformed about what's important. 

Or you might end up teaching it that almost nothing
is important\ldots (``everything's on the exam!'')


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Step Three: Recompile}



Finally, compile the program again.

Inputs: source plus training data.

Outputs: (you hope) a better output executable than from static analysis alone.


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary Graphic}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/pogo-workflow.jpg}
\end{center}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Save Some Steps}



Not necessary to do all three steps for every build. 

Re-use training data while it's still valid.

Recommended dev workflow:
\begin{itemize}
\item dev A performs these steps, checks the training data into source control
\item whole team can use profiling information for their compiles.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Not fixing all the problems in the world}



What does it mean for it to be better? 

The algorithms will aim for speed in areas that are ``hot''. 

The algorithms will aim for minimal code size in areas that are ``cold'' .

Less than 5\% of methods compiled for speed.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Combining Training Runs}



Can combine multiple training runs and manually give suggestions about important scenarios.

The more a scenario runs in the training data, \\
the more important it will be, from POGO's point of view.

Can merge multiple runs with user-assigned weightings.

\frametitle{Behind the Scenes}



In the optimize phase, compiler uses the training data for:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Full and partial inlining
\item Function layout
\item Speed and size decision
\item Basic block layout 
\item Code separation
\item Virtual call speculation
\item Switch expansion
\item Data separation
\item Loop unrolling
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Muh Gainz}



Most performance gains from inlining.

Decisions based on the call graph path profiling. 

But: behaviour of function \texttt{foo} may be very different when called from \texttt{B} than when called from \texttt{D}.

\frametitle{Another Call Graph}


Example 2 of relationships between functions.\\
Numbers on edges represent the number of invocations:

\frametitle{The POGO View of the World}

When considering what to do here, POGO takes the view like this:

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Page Locality}



Call graph profiling data also good for packing blocks.

Put most common cases nearby.\\
Put successors after their predecessors.

Packing related code = fewer page faults (cache misses).

Calling a function in same page as caller =  ``page locality''.

\frametitle{Block Layout}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dead Code?}



According to the author, ``dead'' code goes in its own special block. 

Probably not truly dead code (compile-time unreachable).

Instead: code that never gets invoked in training.

\frametitle{Benchmark Results}
 
OK, how well does POGO work?

The application under test is a standard benchmark suite (Spec2K):


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l}
	\textbf{Spec2k:} & \textbf{sjeng} & \textbf{gobmk} & \textbf{perl} & \textbf{povray} & \textbf{gcc}\\ \hline
	\textbf{App Size:} &  {Small} & {Medium} & {Medium} & {Medium} & {Large} \\ \hline
	\textbf{Inlined Edge Count} & 50\% & 53\% & 25\% & 79\% & 65\% \\ \hline
	\textbf{Page Locality} & 97\% & 75\% & 85\% & 98\% & 80\% \\ \hline
	\textbf{Speed Gain} & 8.5\% & 6.6\% & 14.9\% & 36.9\% & 7.9\% \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

 
We can speculate about how well synthetic benchmarks results translate to real-world application performance\ldots
