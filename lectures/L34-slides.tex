\frametitle{DevOps for P4P}

\large

So far, one-off computations:
you need to answer a question, so you write code to do that.

But many systems are long-running (``generally available'').\\
$\Rightarrow$ Operations.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Keep it Rolling}

\Large
Cloud computing: often long-lived systems,\\
but we didn't talk about how.\\[1em]
Today: many companies fuse\\
development (writes the software) \\
and operations (tends the software).

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Start Me Up}

\Large

Startups:\\[1em]
No money to pay for separate \\
developer and operations teams.\\[1em]
Not that many servers, \\
just a few demo systems, test systems, etc\ldots\\
but it spirals out from there. \\[1em]
You're not really going to ask Sales to manage these servers, are you? \\
So, there's DevOps. 


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{DevOps---Good Plan?}

\large

Is DevOps a good idea? \\
Can be used for both good and evil. \\[1em]
Good:
\begin{itemize}
\item developers involved across the software lifecycle.\\
(can learn a lot doing ops\ldots )
\item developers motivated to use correct tools \& document processes.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Continuous Integration}

Each change or related group of changes is evaluated:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pull from version Control
	\item Build
	\item Test
	\item Report results
\end{itemize}

Social convention to not break the build! Slack/Teams/etc. notifications.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Configuration as Code}

\large

Systems have long come with \\
complicated (``flexible'') configuration options.


Sendmail is particularly notorious, but apache and nginx aren't super
easy to configure either.

First principle: treat \emph{configuration as code}.


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Configuration as Code}

\large

\begin{itemize}
\item use version control on your configuration.
\item implement code reviews on changes to the configuration.
\item test your configurations.
\item aim for a suite of modular services that integrate together smoothly.
\item refactor configuration files.
\item use continuous builds.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Autoconfig}

\large

Excellent idea: tools for configuration. \\[1em]

Not enough to write text \\
\qquad ``How to Install AwesomeApp'' \\[1em]

e.g. use Terraform---\\
build, installation, and update automatic \& simple.\\[1em]

 Complicated means mistakes\ldots people forget steps. They are human. 
 
 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Terraform}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/terraform.png}
\end{center}

Its whole purpose is to manage your config as codes
situation where you want to run your code using a cloud provider (e.g., AWS).

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Planning is Essential}

Terraform has a \emph{plan} operation: can verify the change it's about to make. 

Verify that we aren't about to give all our money to Jeff Bezos but also that a small change is actually small.

If you are happy with the change, \emph{apply} it---but things can change between plan and apply!

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Destructive Changes}

You can accidentally tell it you want to destroy all Github groups and people DM you thinking that this means they got fired.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Common Infrastructure}

\large

Use APIs to access your infrastructure. Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item storage
\item naming and discovery
\item monitoring
\end{itemize}

Avoid one-offs---use open-source tools when applicable.\\
But build your own tools if needed.


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Oh, Think Twice...}

Is this what we are best at?

Think extra carefully if you plan to do roll-your-own anything that is security or encryption related.

Also, remember that platforms like AWS are constantly launching new tools.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Naming}

\Large

Naming is one of the hard problems in computing. 

There are only two hard things in computers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item cache invalidation,
\item naming things, and
\item off by one errors.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Naming Suggestions}

\large

\begin{itemize}
\item use canonical one-word names for servers;
\item but, use aliases to specify functions: geography/environment/purpose/serial
\end{itemize}


There's also the Java package approach of infinite dots: live.application.customer.webdomain.com

Pick something and be consistent.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Billing or Potato?}

Debates rage about whether names should be meaningful or fun.

If the service is called \texttt{billing} it may be helpful in determining what it does, more so than if it were called \texttt{potato}.

But when you say the word do you mean the service or the team?

What if we need a new billing service? \texttt{billing2}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Descriptive Names aren't Magic}

I've seen examples where the teams are called (anonymized a bit) ``X~infrastructure'' and ``X operations''.

I'd estimate that 35\% of queries to each team result in a reply that says that the question should go to the other team. 

It gets worse when a team is responsible for a common or shared component (e.g., a library). 

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Naming Solutions}

Real solution is like service discovery: tool with directory info.

Something like Opslevel exists; use it!

And don't forget that fun has a morale impact. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Servers as Cattle, not Pets}

\large

Servers means servers, or virtual machines, or containers.\\[1em]

At scale (smaller than you think):\\
use mass tools for dealing with servers, \\
rather than doing tasks manually. \\[1em]

At least: cloud-like server initialization without manual intervention;\\
must be able to spin up a server programmatically.


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Another Example}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/Kubernetes.jpg}
\end{center}

This is used to automate deploying and scaling of applications.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Canarying}

\large

Deploy new code incrementally in production, \\
also known as ``test in prod'':


\begin{itemize}
\item stage for deployment;
\item remove canary servers from service;
\item upgrade canary servers;
\item run automatic tests on upgraded canaries;
\item reintroduce canary servers into service;
\item see how it goes!
\end{itemize}

Of course: implement your system with rollback.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Manual install
	\item Package Manager (RPM/JAR/DLL Hell)
	\item Virtual Machines
	\item Containerization
\end{itemize}
