# Lecture 25 — Profiling: Observing Operations

## Roadmap

We'll do a flashback from Lecture 1 (Computers are Fast) and then we are going
to do two in-class exercises: one on ad-hoc profiling and one on using perf
record/perf annotate/perf flamegraph.

## Computers Are Fast (5 minutes)

Normally I'd do this quiz by Julia Evans in Lecture 1, but we weren't meeting in
person then, so we'll do it now.

What surprised you most?

## Perf and flamegraphs live demo (20 minutes)

The live demo is the code in `lectures/live-coding/L25/math`. Note that the
`debug = true` flag is set in [profile.release].

```
$ cargo build
$ perf record target/debug/math
$ perf report
$ perf annotate
```

make runs the Makefile which generates the flamegraph. We can look at the
flamegraph for the ad-hoc profiling example above, as well. That will probably
be a better flamegraph.

## Ad-Hoc Profiling (40 minutes)

OK, try to use `perf` on [imager](https://github.com/imager-io/imager).

We are going to practice ad-hoc profiling. I suspect that a single routine is
responsible for all of the runtime. perf can tell you this quite easily, but
it's good to have the skill of setting up a timer as well.

You can download any jpeg from the Internet and use it as a workload or simply
use the [benchmarks](https://github.com/colbyn/imager-bench-2019-11-2) imager
used

Note: imager is complicated to compile because it requires webp devel libs,
which are currently not installed on ecetesla machines. Docker might be the
easiest way to compile imager. Try
[oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) instead. This will take a while
(it's the hackathon effect). You can also try flamegraphs on oxipng.
