# Lecture 25 â€” Profiling: Observing Operations

## Roadmap

We'll do a flashback from Lecture 1 (Computers are Fast) and then we are going
to do two in-class exercises: one on ad-hoc profiling and one on using perf
record/perf annotate/perf flamegraph.

## Computers Are Fast (5 minutes)

Normally I'd do this quiz by Julia Evans in Lecture 1, but we weren't meeting in
person then, so we'll do it now.

[Computers are Fast](https://computers-are-fast.github.io/)

What surprised you most?

## Perf and flamegraphs live demo (20 minutes)

The live demo is the code in `lectures/live-coding/L25/math`.

```
$ cargo build
$ perf record target/debug/math
$ perf report
$ perf annotate
```

We can do the same to the release version. Note that the `debug = true` flag is
set in [profile.release]. We may notice latest compiler seems to eliminate
functions other than `main()`.

`make` runs the Makefile which generates the flamegraph. We can look at the
flamegraph for the ad-hoc profiling example above, as well. That will probably
be a better flamegraph.

## Ad-Hoc Profiling (40 minutes)

OK, try to use `perf` on [imager](https://github.com/imager-io/imager).

We are going to practice ad-hoc profiling. I suspect that a single routine is
responsible for all of the runtime. `perf` can tell you this quite easily, but
it's good to have the skill of setting up a timer as well.

You can download any jpeg from the Internet and use it as a workload or simply
use the [benchmarks](https://github.com/colbyn/imager-bench-2019-11-2) imager
used

Note: imager is complicated to compile because it requires webp devel libs,
which are currently not installed on ecetesla machines. Docker might be the
easiest way to compile imager. Try
[oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) instead. This will take a while
(it's the hackathon effect). You can also try flamegraphs on oxipng.

# After-action report, plam, 17 Mar 2023

This year, did not do "computers are fast" here because did it in
L1.

* perf and flamegraph worked on ecetesla1 this year. Good to check before class. Did live demos.
* did not do ad-hoc profiling, to get through lectures faster. imager currently compiles on ece machines. Did talk about it. I think it could work if there was a bunch of time.
