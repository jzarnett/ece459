# Lecture 26 â€” Profiling and Scalability

## Roadmap

Scalability principles, then live demo of looking at system status.

## Four Principles [5 minutes]

Mini lecture. Not getting bitten by scalability differences: try to match the real workloads as much as possible on:
* Hardware
* Reality/representativeness of workload
* Volume
and keep your tests reproducible.

Also, performance regression testing, i.e. as seen in [https://arewefastyet.com] for Firefox.

## Collecting evidence [10 minutes]

Let's look at system usage (live demo).

* CPU: top (vs # of CPUs, `lscpu`)
* Memory: top, `ps -eo min_flt,maj_flt,cmd`, `vmstat 5`
* Disk: `iostat -dx /dev/sda 5`
* Network: `nload`

You can use this information to try to remove bottlenecks.

# After-action report, plam, 20 Mar 2023

About 30 minutes.

Developed principles in discussion with students.

Did live demos for the monitoring software. Did not manage to drive up %util. I wonder if it needs to be used for 
an extended time.
