# Lecture 12 â€” Dependencies and Speculation

## Dependencies

Talk about loop-carried and memory-carried dependencies.

## Breaking Dependencies with Speculation

### Speculative Execution for Threads

Exercise: consider the following code, if you can create extra threads to
calculate the results of `long_calculation` and `second_long_calculation`, how
can you speed up the code potentially?

```rust
fn do_work(x: i32, y: i32, threshold: i32) -> i32 {
    let val = long_calculation(x, y);
    if val > threshold {
        return val + second_long_calculation(x, y);
    }
    return val;
}
```

Question: when is your modified code faster? When is it slower? How could you
improve the use of threads?

### Value Speculation

Exercise: consider the following code, if you can somehow predict the result of
`long_calculation`, how can you speed up the code potentially?

```rust
fn do_other_work(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    let val = long_calculation(x, y);
    return second_long_calculation(val);
}
```

Question: when is your modified code faster? When is it slower? How could you
improve the use of threads?

## Software Transactional Memory

The idea resembles database transactions. The code in the atomic block either
executes completely, or aborts/rolls back in the event of a conflict with
another transaction (which triggers a retry later on, and repeated retries if
necessary to get it applied).

### Benefits

- simple programming model.

### Problems

- Rollback is key to STM. But, some things cannot be rolled back. (write to the
  screen, send packet over network)
- Nested transactions.
- Limited transaction size. Most implementations (especially all-hardware) have
  a limited transaction size.
- Currently slow, but a lot of research is going into improving it.
- Intermediate states may still become visible in real implementation. (Maybe
  this doesn't happen in the Rust implementation because of fearless
  concurrency, but it certainly can in C/C++ versions of STM.)

### Example

Talk about this if time permits

```rust
/*

// unfornately, not runnable on rustexplorer

[dependencies]
stm = "0.4.0"
*/

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
use stm::atomically;
use stm::TVar;

fn main() {
    // create var
    let var = TVar::new(0);
    let varc = var.clone(); // Clone for other thread.

    // spawn a thread
    let t = thread::spawn(move || {
        atomically(|tx| {
            // read the var
            let x = varc.read(tx)?;
            // ensure that x varc changes in between
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));

            // write back modified data this should only
            // happen when the value has not changed
            varc.write(tx, x + 10)
        });
    });

    // ensure that the thread has started and already read the var
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    // now change it before the transaction finishes
    atomically(|tx| var.write(tx, 32));

    // finish and compare
    let _ = t.join();

    println!("{:?}", var.read_atomic());
    // ^ `read_atomic` reads a value atomically, without starting a transaction.

    // it turns out var = 42, because the thread will rerun its transaction when
    // the var changes while executing
}
```

# After-action report, plam, 10Feb23

Gave examples of memory-carried dependencies, and loop-carried dependencies (Lab 2).

Speculation: worked through calculating the expected runtime.

STM: we can probably drop this topic, it's not hot anymore. Mentioned it briefly.
