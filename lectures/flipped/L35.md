# Lecture 35 â€” DevOps: Operations

## Roadmap

I thought of 3 potential exercises in this DevOps space. We can look at them and decide which order to do them in (and how many to do).

## Naming

Let's develop a naming scheme for our herds of (literal) cows. How can we apply the principles in the lecture to
this problem?

## Dockerization

This is pretty cookbook, but you can follow these instructions for creating a Docker image of a Node.js
application.

## GitHub Actions

I figured out how to use GitHub Actions to compile the TeX files automatically. Probably the easiest CI thing is to
run test cases for a project automatically. Pick some Java project and set up a GitHub action for it.

# After-action report, plam, 3 Apr 2023

Did the naming exercise. Did not do the other exercises. Instead, we
collectively talked through an example of writing an incident report
(fake, "patricklam.ca is down"). That works as an exercise, though
maybe one could read an existing incident report also. Or have a
better scenario.
