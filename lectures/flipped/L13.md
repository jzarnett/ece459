# Lecture 13 â€” Early Termination, Reduced-Resource Computation

## Two basic ideas

- skip some parts of work
- intentionally reduce accuracy to speed things up

Activity: think of some examples?

## N-body problem

Simple ideas are computing the forces in parallel and using `float` instead of
`double`. But what if we want more?

### live-coding

(See `live-coding/L13`)

Walk through the N-body code

Walk through the N-body code with bins, talk about the differences

Compare the runtimes

## Other

Talk about the **fast inverse square root** in Quoke III (very interesting!) and
**loop perforation** if time permits.

# After-action report, huanyi, 08Feb23

Went through all the n-body sample codes. However, it turns out the bin version
does not speed up much. Need to take a look sometime later.

# After-action report, plam, 10Feb23

Gave the example of Lab 2 and not requiring exact answers.

Showed the Rubik's Cube example (it's not a great visualization).

Did not do the sqrt example in detail.

Talked about N-body problem and the old Lab 3.

Loop perforation: talked about an example of summing a bunch of numbers.
