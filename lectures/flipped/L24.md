# Lecture 24 â€” Password Cracking, Bitcoin Mining

## Roadmap

There are two things from the recorded lecture that I want to underline:
password storage, and Bitcoin mining. Then, the classroom exercises will be
about using and computing rainbow tables.

## Rant 1: Password storage [5 minutes]

* Best practice: federated login (e.g. Google, Waterloo ADFS).
* Worst practice: storing passwords in plaintext.

You don't want to show up in [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com).
Not storing data (and not forcing your users to store passwords) is best. But if
you must, don't store in plaintext. Salt your salads and your encrypted
passwords.

## Creating rainbow tables [25 minutes]

I've created Python file "hash-and-reduce.py" which does almost the
thing in "[How Rainbow Tables
Work](https://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables)" by Kuliukas; it
operates on 7-digit numbers instead of 6-digit numbers, but otherwise
it's the same. That is, it takes a 7-digit number (e.g. a phone
number) as command-line input and outputs the MD5sum and the
reduction, which is another 7-digit number obtained from the MD5sum.
A real rainbow table also uses different reduction functions 
at different positions on chains, but we won't do that here for simplicity.

* Your task: run "hash-and-reduce.py" on an input of your choice through 10
cycles and report the initial plaintext and final hash. Imagine how a GPU can do
this efficiently. Come up and write your plaintext and hash on the board.

## Using rainbow tables [20 minutes]

OK, now we have information about some precomputed hash chains
(a simpler version of rainbow tables). Let's use it to reverse the hash 
for an input. I will do an example and then you can try one.

Let's say that you have a hash that you want to lookup the plaintext
for. We'll assume that it's one of the plaintexts that is in our
table. How do you get the hash you want to lookup? For the purpose
of this exercise, take one of your plaintexts and hash it.

OK, so now you have a hash that you want to reverse. But the hash
function is one-way. So you repeatedly reduce it and hash it
and (given your choice of hash) you'll eventually encounter one of the
final hashes.

* How many times do you need to do this before you can give up?

OK, now you have a final hash that matches. Start with the initial
plaintext and run through until you hit the hash that you're
trying to reverse, to check that you didn't have a false positive collision.
The thing just before that is the plaintext
you're looking for.

## Rant 2: Bitcoin mining [5 minutes]

Ugh, bitcoin. Funny how bitcoin still has to interact with the normal banking
system through trusted intermediaries. And NFTs seem to be getting stolen often,
litigated in the courts, and again depend on trusted intermediaries. Anyway,
energy using is horrific; and, Proof-Of-Stake just doesn't seem to happen, and
results in rich-get-richer. Why not just use a database?

Anyway, the lecture develops the concept of going beyond GPUs and using custom
hardware to mine Bitcoin.

# After-action report, plam, 27 Feb 2023

I did the rainbow table exercise and realized that it wasn't as clear as it
could be. After lecture, I rewrote the rainbow table exercise to clarify it.
I did talk about Bitcoins, although the popularity of NFTs has waned
now at least, and Ethereum has moved to proof-of-stake.
