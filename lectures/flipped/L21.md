# Lecture 21 â€” Performance Case Study, Performance Culture

## Roadmap

We have a case study about performance work in Firefox and then some discussion
about the softer side of software engineering&mdash;how to ensure that your
software is performant. The in-class exercises for this lecture are mostly about
what you have seen in your co-op jobs.

## Performance Case Study [10 minutes]

Let's consider the code changes discussed in this [Firefox performance
update](https://mikeconley.ca/blog/2018/02/14/firefox-performance-update-1/).
Put the ideas into into categories:

* do less work (or do it sooner/later);
* use threads (move work off main thread);
* track performance;

Can you think of another example of a change that you've seen in each of the
categories?

## Performance Laws / Tips / Culture [20 minutes]

What performance improvements have you seen in your coop jobs? Talk about how
they came to happen.

* What do you think about language choice?
* Have you observed small details or resource usage issues?
* Have you done experiments?
* More hardware: a blessing or a curse?
* What order of magnitude have you worked with?
* Culture: have you seen any of the warning signs? what metrics have you seen?

# After-action report, plam, 17 Mar 2023

Had 4 students come to class. Did whole-class discussions on all these
things. This exercise can work. 30 minutes is about right.
