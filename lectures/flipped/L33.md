# Lecture 33 â€” More Advanced Queueing Theory

## Roadmap

We will discuss the new considerations that may cause complications in queueing theory, then we will do some simulation exercises.

## New considerations/complications [10 minutes]

Let's discuss possible complications to queueing theory, which should collectively form the points mentioned in the lecture notes.

## Simulations [20 minutes]

Checkout the original code <https://github.com/TouringPlans/shapeland>. If you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>, you can run it directly. Otherwise, you can use the python script I put together in `flipped/L33/amusement_park_sim.py`. Move it into the shapeland repo that you have cloned to run it. You may need to use `pip` to install the necessary dependencies.

Note that there's a plot about "age class", but we don't use it so we don't need to care about it.

Change the `RNG_SEED = 5` to a different value and try exploring following settings:

* 20,000 agents and keep other parameters unchanged (Default is `TOTAL_DAILY_AGENTS = 2000`, which doesn't make sense).
* 20,000 agents, single attraction, and single activity
* 5,000 agents, single attraction, and single activity (much less workload in this case)
* Single attraction, and single activity, but all agents are Ride Enthusiast or Activity Enthusiast
* Try tweaking other parameters

(I put some sample plots in `flipped/L33`, see if they are different from yours)

I did the discussion and the simulation. However, the labels in the Approximate Agent Distributions seem to be incorrect when all agents are Ride Enthusiast or Activity Enthusiast.

Yes, it is definitely possible to get the students to run the simulation. Probably 30-40 minutes is a better guess about time.
