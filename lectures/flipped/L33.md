# Lecture 33 — More Advanced Queueing Theory

## Roadmap

We will discuss the new considerations that may cause complications in queueing
theory, then we will do some simulation exercises.

## New considerations/complications [10 minutes]

Let's discuss possible complications to queueing theory, which should
collectively form the points mentioned in the lecture notes.

## Simulations [20 minutes]

Checkout the original code <https://github.com/TouringPlans/shapeland>. If you
have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>, you can run it
directly. Otherwise, you can use the python script I put together in
`flipped/L33/amusement_park_sim.py`. Move it into the shapeland repo that you
have cloned to run it. You may need to use `pip` to install the necessary
dependencies.

Note that there's a plot about "age class", but we don't use it so we don't need
to care about it.

Change the `RNG_SEED = 5` to a different value and try exploring following
settings:

* 20,000 agents and keep other parameters unchanged (Default is
  `TOTAL_DAILY_AGENTS = 2000`, which doesn't make sense).
* 20,000 agents, single attraction, and single activity
* 5,000 agents, single attraction, and single activity (much less workload in
  this case)
* Single attraction, and single activity, but all agents are Ride Enthusiast or
  Activity Enthusiast
* Try tweaking other parameters

(I put some sample plots in `flipped/L33`, see if they are different from yours)

Checkout 58:00-1:10:00 in the YouTube video to see some results they got.

# After-action report, huanyi, 29 Mar 2023

I did the discussion and the simulation. However, the labels in the Approximate
Agent Distributions seem to be incorrect when all agents are Ride Enthusiast or
Activity Enthusiast.

# After-action report, plam, 31 Mar 2023

Yes, it is definitely possible to get the students to run the simulation.
Probably 30-40 minutes is a better guess about time.

# After-action report, huanyi, 25Mar24

I talked about the FastPass part using the slide. I think there are errors in
the simulation code, even with its default configuration.
