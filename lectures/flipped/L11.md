# Lecture 11 — Lock Convoys, Atomics, Lock-Freedom

## Roadmap

We will talk about the lock convoy problem, and some things we can use to avoid
using locks entirely.

## Lock Convoys

Activity: given a lock (say a marker), 4 students play as threads with the same
priority, of which 3 need the lock and 1 doesn't; one additional student plays
as the scheduler.

- Once the lock is free, a random thread picks up the lock then informs the
  scheduler to pick the next thread to run.
- The scheduler doesn't see which thread owns the lock. It picks the next-to-run
  thread randomly.

The possible actions for the threads are:
- Threads that need the lock: attempt to acquire the lock/wait for the lock, and
  eventually release the lock.
- Thread that doesn't need the lock: just runs normally (gets a bunch of
  execution, e.g., writing down numbers from 1 to 100.)

Let's see how many times the scheduler picks the wrong thread to run.

## Trylock

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let mut retries = 0;
    let retries_limit = 10;
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);

    loop {
        if retries < retries_limit {
            let l = counter.try_lock();
            // ^ try_lock helps since if A is going to release the critical
            // section, B does not immediately become the owner (since it is not
            // yet its turn). A may keep running and A might even get the
            // critical section again during the same time slice before B tries
            // to acquire the lock (and may succeed).
            if l.is_ok() {
                *l.unwrap() = 1;
                break;
            } else {
                retries = retries + 1;
                thread::yield_now();
                // ^ give up the remaining time slice if try_lock failed
            }
        } else {
            // in case the critical section belongs to a low priority thread and
            // we need the current thread to be blocked so the low priority
            // thread can run
            *counter.lock().unwrap() = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    println!("done");
}
```

## Atomics

### load and store

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

fn main() {
    let b = AtomicBool::new(false);
    b.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
    println!("{}", b.load(Ordering::SeqCst));
}
```

### compare and exchange

Implementing a spinlock

```rust
use std::hint;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

fn main() {
    let my_lock = AtomicBool::new(false);
    // ... Other stuff happens
    while my_lock.compare_exchange(false, true,
                                   Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::SeqCst) == Err(true) {
        // compare_exchange(current, new, ...)
        //     success: Ok(previous)
        //     fail: Err(previous)
        // The lock was 'true', someone else has the lock, so try again
        hint::spin_loop();
        // ^ The spin loop is a hint to the CPU that we're waiting, but probably
        // not for very long
    }
    // Inside critical section
    my_lock.store(false, Ordering::SeqCst);
    println!("Done!");
}
```

### ABA problem

## Lock Freedom

Discuss about non-blocking, blocking, lock-free, and wait-free. See
<https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/non_blocking_lock_free_and_wait_free.html>

Also, <https://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/>

A quick summary:

- non-blocking/blocking: blocking does not cost CPU time, but non-blocking does
- lock-free: other thread can still proceed even when the thread holding the
  lock is suspended. Spinlock is not lock-free, but it is non-blocking.
- wait-free: a lock-free data structure with the additional property that
  every thread accessing the data structure can make complete its operation
  within a bounded number of steps

Question: Are lock-free programming techniques always better for performance?

# After-action report, huanyi, 06Feb23

Only briefly talked about the `loop` inside the lock-free stack, but since
that's the major component so I guess it's ok.

# After-action report, plam, 10Feb23

Better specified the lock convoy example. (Now improved in the text above.)

Typed in the code examples.

Did not talk about ABA. Briefly mentioned lock freedom, but not in great detail.

# After-action report, huanyi, 29Jan24

I did the lock convoy activity. It would be better to ask thread students to
write down if the scheduler picked them correctly or incorrectly.

# After-action report, huanyi, 02Feb24

I did all the coding and also talked about the lock freedom. I didn't explain
Ordering::SeqCst much, which will be discussed in later lectures.
