# Lecture 15: Crossbeam and Rayon

## Scoped thread in std::thread

We can use the Rust standard library (since Rust 1.63.0).

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
thread-id = "4.0.0"
*/

use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("main thread has id {}", thread_id::get());

    thread::scope(|scope| {
        scope.spawn(|| {
            println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
            println!("Now in thread with id {}", thread_id::get());
        });
    });

    println!("Vector v is back: {:?}", v);
}
```

## Scoped thread in Crossbeam

We can also use the Crossbeam library to do it.

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
crossbeam = "0.8.0"
thread-id = "4.0.0"
*/

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("main thread has id {}", thread_id::get());

    crossbeam::scope(|scope| {
        scope.spawn(|_| {
            println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
            println!("Now in thread with id {}", thread_id::get());
        });
    }).unwrap();

    println!("Vector v is back: {:?}", v);
}
```

## Multi-producer and Multi-consumer

## Data Parallelism with Rayon

### Parallelizing loops

use Rust explorer to run following code.

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
rayon = "1.6.1"
*/

use rayon::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    println!("without rayon");
    (0..10).for_each(|x| println!("{:?}", x));
    println!("with rayon");
    (0..10).into_par_iter().for_each(|x| println!("{:?}", x));
}
```

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
rayon = "1.6.1"
*/

use std::time::Instant;
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let arr: Vec<i128> = (1..10_000_000).collect();
    println!("sum = {}", sum_of_squares(&arr));
}

fn sum_of_squares(input: &[i128]) -> i128 {
    let start = Instant::now();
    let res = input.iter()
        // ^ change iter() to par_iter() and check the elapsed time
        .map(|i| i * i)
        .sum();
    println!("{:?}", Instant::now() - start);
    res
}
```

Exercise: make use of `for_each_with` to combine data parallelization with message passing

One example is provided on <https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html#method.for_each_with>

# After-action report, huanyi, 06Feb23 (substituting for Patrick)

A producer-consumer live coding to show how to use the Crossbeam channel seems
slightly over. Changing it to a lighter example would be better.
