# Lecture 30 — Clusters & Cloud Computing

## Roadmap

Kafka, clouds, and clusters vs laptops.

## Kafka [10 minutes]

We will play with the parameters here:

[https://softwaremill.com/kafka-visualisation/]

and gain some understanding of how Kafka works.

For example, we can start with 1 for every setting. Hover your mouse around to
see explanations.

## Cloud computing: when to use? [10 minutes]

In the notes, I talked about using Amazon EC2 vs ecetesla machines. Calculate
the relative costs of using EC2 vs buying machines with Teslas (you'll need to
estimate usage.)

## Clusters vs laptops [5 minutes]

Why are clusters sometimes so slow?

## Movie Hour

See the link in the lecture notes.

# After-action report, plam, 24 Mar 2023

Kafka can be a 20 minute exercise. It's a good visualization. Beware z vs s in
visualization spelling. Students took a while to estimate cost of computers.

# After-action report, huanyi, 18Mar24

Did a quick demo of the kafka visualization.
