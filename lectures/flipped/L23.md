# L23 GPUs (host side)

## Roadmap

Having talked about the GPU side in Lecture 22, let's continue and talk about the
host (CPU) side here. Up today, we have some live coding and some experimentation
(on your own computers/eceteslas).

## Live coding [20 minutes]

I'll type in the sample host code from the L23 notes, hopefully without too many typos. Then 
I'll run three versions of nbody: nbody sequential (L14), nbody-parallel (L14), and cuda, and 
we'll see what happens. I'll mention `nvprof` but we won't use it yet.

## Experimentation [45 minutes]

Again with the `calculate_forces` code we (you) can experiment with tweaking the threads
per block and the grid size, and see how fast it is with various choices. There's also
an issue with dividing evenly---check your accelerations to make sure that you're not
getting 0s where you shouldn't be---and with indexing with respect to the work-item ID.
The version you can tweak is in `live-coding/L23/nbody-cuda`.
You need to tweak the launch call and the `calculate_forces` call.

If you just want to look at the answer (less educational!), it's in 
`live-coding/L23/nbody-cuda-grid`.
