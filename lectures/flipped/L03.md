# Mini-lecture: live coding

## Borrowing example

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let len = calculate_length(&s1); // lend s1 to callee
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // borrowed s
  s.len() // note: return last expression in fn
}
```

## Can also mutably borrow

```rust
// call calculate_length_and_vandalize(&mut s);

fn calculate_length_and_vandalize(s: &mut String) -> usize {
  s.push('0');
  s.len();
}
```

## Exercise: convert this code to not use borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
  let v = vec![String::from("q"), String::from("r")];
  let len = calculate_length(&v); // lend s1 to callee
  println!("The length of '{:?}' is {}.", v, len);
}

fn calculate_length(v: &Vec<String>) -> usize {
  v.len() // note: return last expression in fn
}
```

## Thread example

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
  let handle = thread::spawn(|| { // closure
    for i in 1..10 {
      println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
      thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
  });
  
  for i in 1..5 {
    println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
  }
  handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

## Beware, you will encounter this

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
  let v = vec![1,2,3];

  let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
    println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
  });

  handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

## Message passing example

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

  thread::spawn(move || {
    let val = String::from("hi");
    tx.send(val).unwrap();
  });

  let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
  println!("Got: {}", received);
}
```

## Exercise: Message passing challenge

Modify the above example so that the created thread takes two ints
from main(), adds them, and passes the sum back along the channel.

# After-action report, plam

* talked about the concept of borrowing
* live coded the borrowing and mutable borrowing
* had students do the convert code example, 10 minutes (took us to 30 minutes in)

* live coded the thread examples and added the move to the "beware" example
* live coded the message passing example
* had students do the message passing challenge, some students are fast, others need the full 10 minutes I allocated
* a student helpfully asked "well, ok, but can we do shared memory too?" and I was like "Aha! That's coming up soon!"
