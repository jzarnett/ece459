# Lecture 22 — GPU Programming Continued

## Roadmap

Having talked about the GPU side in Lecture 22, let's continue and talk about
the host (CPU) side here.

## Live coding [20 minutes]

* The sample host code in the lecture notes. See
<https://github.com/bheisler/RustaCUDA/blob/6b076722d593288a1fe58e8d7626e51da158e2f1/examples/launch.rs>

* Also it is worth reading rustacuda's [official
  doc](https://docs.rs/rustacuda/latest/rustacuda/)

* check the runtime
  * nbody sequential, no bins (`live-coding/L13/nbody`),
  * nbody-parallel, no bins (`live-coding/L13/nbody-parallel`)
  * nbody-cuda (`live-coding/L23/nbody-cuda`)

Mention `nvprof` but we won't use it yet (L27).

## Experimentation [45 minutes]

Again with the `calculate_forces` code we (you) can experiment with tweaking the
threads per block and the grid size, and see how fast it is with various
choices. There's also an issue with dividing evenly---check your accelerations
to make sure that you're not getting 0s where you shouldn't be---and with
indexing with respect to the work-item ID. The version you can tweak is in
`live-coding/L23/nbody-cuda`. You need to tweak the launch call and the
`calculate_forces` call.

If you just want to look at the answer (less educational!), it's in
`live-coding/L23/nbody-cuda-grid`.

# After-action report, huanyi, 15Feb23

Used the documents in the lab 3 manual as well, which I think was useful.
