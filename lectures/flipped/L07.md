# Lecture 07: CPU Hardware, Branch Prediction

## CPU info

```sh
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

## Likely and Unlikely

## switch to nightly rustc
```sh
rustup default nightly
# to switch back
# rustup default stable
```

Then we can enable `core_intrinsics`

```rust
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]
use std::intrinsics::{likely, unlikely};

fn f(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a
}
fn main() {
    let size = 100000;
    let large_vector = vec![0; size];
    let mut m1 = 0;
    let mut m2 = 0;
    for _j in 0..1000 {
        for k in 0..size {
            // if unlikely(*large_vector.get(k).unwrap() == 0) {
            // if likely(*large_vector.get(k).unwrap() == 0) {
            if *large_vector.get(k).unwrap() == 0 {
                m1 = f(m1 + 1)
            } else {
                m2 = f(m2 + 1)
            }
        }
    }
    println!("m1 = {}; m2 = {}", m1, m2);
}
```

Timing

```sh
hyperfine --warmup 3 'cargo run --release'
```

## Side-channel attacks

### Cache attack

Meltdown

```C
// toy example
data = *kernel_address; // cause exception
access(probe_array[data * 4096]);
// ^ the line is never reached
// but probe_array[data * 4096] gets read into the cache
// if probe_array[i] can be accessed with a much smaller time than
// the time to access other probe_array[j], then data = i/4096;
```

### Cache attack, plam version

Spectre

Idea: use cache timing information to figure out what a given bit (supposedly inaccessible) is.

Let's build up the attack. 

Step 1: observe that loading from cache is much faster than loading from memory. Act that out by asking for a value; the value either comes from on top of the desk (cache) or inside the cabinet (memory).

Step 2: ok, now there is a value V that you want to know what it is. If you ask, the CPU won't tell you. But before it checks that it's not supposed to tell you V, it will start doing the array read. That's supposed to be OK because it's supposed to rollback before it tells you.

Step 3: aha, let's do more speculative execution: based on V, load different parts of memory into cache (act that out). Then use the observation in step 1.

1. if (untrusted_offset < arr1->length) {     // supposed to fail, but predicted true
2.  value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset];     // not supposed to run, but because of speculation, does actually load value (you're not supposed to see it)

OK, so now we "have" value, which we're not really supposed to have access to. Let's use another array to decipher what it contains.

3.  index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200          // can also use other bits besides &1
4.  if (index2 < arr2->length) {    // again this is supposed to be false, and yet...
5.   value2 = arr2->data[index2];   //  trigger load of arr2->data[0x200] if bit false, 0x300 if true
6.  }

Then measure how long to load from arr2->data at index 0x200 and 0x300.

### Hyperthreading attack

In hyperthreading, two threads are sharing the same execution core. That means
they have hardware in common. Because of this, a thread can figure out what the
other thread is doing by timing how long it takes to complete instructions.

# After-action report, plam, 23Jan23

Had the students try likely/unlikely example.

Did not do a cache attack, will do that on Friday.
