# Lecture 06: Modern Processors

- Pipelining

- Register renaming

```asm
MOV R2, R7 + 32
ADD R1, R2
MOV R2, R9 + 64
ADD R3, R2
```

- Speculation

```asm
ld rax, rbx+16 ; assume cache miss
add rbx, 16    ; carry on anyway, ADD doesn’t need rax value from LD
               ; register renaming => LD (write)/ADD (read) don’t interfere
cmp rax, 0     ; needs rax value, queue till available
jeq null_chk   ; oops! need cmp result
               ; speculate: assume branch not taken
st rbx-16, rcx ; speculatively store to store buf (not L1)
ld rcx, rdx    ; unrelated cache miss: 2 misses now active, 1 speculative
ld rax, rax+8  ; now must wait for result of first LD
```

## Calculation

### q1

Assume we can always find the data in L3 cache, cache miss rates are 40 per 1000
for L1D and 4 per 1000 for L2, and cache miss penalty are 5 cycles for L1D and 300
cycles for L2, what is the average running time for an instruction?

### q2

Assume memory access takes 200 ns and a disk read 8 ms, what is roughly the access time
if you have a page fault?
