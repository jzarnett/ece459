# Lecture 29 â€” Liar, Liar

## Roadmap

I won't actually do "lies from metrics" as it was done in lecture, but next year
I'll ask students to compile the code from
[https://pvk.ca/Blog/2014/10/19/performance-optimisation-~-writing-an-essay/]
and run perf for themselves.

We resume the video-first delivery at "Lies from Counters" and continue doing
exercises from there.

## Lies from averaging [2 minutes]

We'll just quickly distribute numbers to students and calculate an average to
show that averages lie.

## Sampling vs tracing [2 minutes]

We can illustrate a tracing-based approach (beyond what we saw with systemtap)
by counting to 20 and instrumenting every even number (tracing) versus sampling
every 2 seconds.

# After-action report, plam, 20 Mar 2023

I ran the code from the blog post and talked about it. I could not get perf annotate to work for me.
You need to provide one of -DTLB or -DDIV or it will crash with an alignment error.

We talked about averaging and sampling, but we didn't actually do the exercises. I presented the long tail slides.
