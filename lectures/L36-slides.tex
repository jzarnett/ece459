\frametitle{Exam Coverage}

The exam is based on material we have covered in the lectures \& assignments.

The exam is cumulative: covers from the first lecture to the last.

Assignments 1 through 4 are included.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Terms \& Conditions}

This is an open-book, calculators allowed, exam.


Bring your notes (or ours, or both), but be reasonable about what you print.

But it's still written by hand, on paper.

The exam is about applying concepts, not memorizing trivia.

\frametitle{How to Prepare}

How to prepare for the final exam:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Review lecture notes and slides, and flipped class notes.
	\item Review assignments -- especially if LLMs helped a lot.
	\item Try old exams (2024 had an in-person one).
	\item Ask for help if you need it (Piazza).
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Exam Tips}

Tips for the Exam:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item At this point, you know what works well for you -- do that!
	\item A small amount of well-organized notes is better than tons of random info.
	\item Take the time to read the question carefully.
	\item You can use point form instead of full sentences on written questions.
\end{enumerate}

I say this to my 2nd year students:

``The Force is with you, young Skywalker...\\
\quad But you are not a Jedi yet.''

But you're 4th year students. And now you can say:
\begin{center}

\end{center}

``I am a Jedi, like my father before me.''
